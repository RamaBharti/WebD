server is created, which interacts with our browser
server is a local server(local host, our computer)
server has html, css, js, resources etc files
now, from the browser whenever we try to find the html file, eg-index.html, then server will send the file to the browser and we will be seeing a website, this is how backend works
basically, browser will be requesting the server and then server will response
url is basically a request
